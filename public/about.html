<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Bharathi! I’m a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development, databases, and problem-solving. I’m passionate about building practical, user-focused solutions and constantly expanding my skill set.</p>

<p>My experience includes working with technologies like [list a few: e.g., Python, Java, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, React, Laravel], and I enjoy taking projects from concept to deployment. I’ve developed applications ranging from [briefly mention project type: web apps, data-driven tools, or QA testing workflows], and I’m excited to bring that same dedication to professional projects.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in roles such as junior developer, QA tester, data analyst, or technical support engineer — positions where I can grow, contribute to a team, and gain hands-on industry experience.</p>
<p> When I’m not coding, I’m usually reading philosophy books and learning different types of dance forms from all over the world.</p>
<p> I’m actively seeking remote opportunities where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and make a real impact. If you’re looking for a motivated and adaptable entry-level team member, let’s connect!</p>
